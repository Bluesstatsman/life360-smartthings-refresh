# life360-smartthings-refresh
Adding a refresh function to life360 for smartthings

If you installed Life360 though the IDE just update your DH and App with this code and your have a refresh button

If you installed though the smartthings marketplace your probably have to remove all Life360 devices and the app and then install this DH and app though the IDE, enable Oauth on the app, publish to me and install the app from the "My Apps" in the marketplace.

Your end up with this for each life360 device please note doesnt matter which device you use to refresh it will refresh all life360 devices
